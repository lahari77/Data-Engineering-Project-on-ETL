### Data-Engineering-Project-on-ETL

#### Project Overview

The objective of this project is to serve as data engineers for an international financial analysis company. Our primary responsibility is to track and analyze various financial indicators such as stock prices, commodities, forex rates, and inflation rates. To achieve this, we will employ a combination of data collection methods, including API integration, web scraping, and downloading files provided by financial analysis firms.

Our workflow entails extracting relevant financial data from diverse sources, such as websites, APIs, and files in formats like CSV, XML, and JSON. Once the data is collected, we will apply transformation techniques to meet the specific requirements outlined by our company. To ensure effective monitoring and debugging, we will utilize the built-in logging module. Finally, the transformed data will be saved in a format that is optimized for easy loading by data engineers.

Project Tasks:

- Collect financial data using APIs from relevant sources.
- Employ web scraping techniques to gather additional financial data from various websites.
- Download files provided by financial analysis firms for further processing.
- Implement data ingestion and processing for CSV, XML, and JSON file types.
- Extract relevant data from the collected files and APIs.
- Apply transformation procedures to the extracted data based on specified requirements.
- Utilize the logging module to record and monitor the data engineering process.
- Save the transformed data in a format that is ready-to-load, ensuring compatibility for subsequent data loading tasks by data engineers.
